# HR Data Analytics using Power BI & SQL

This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data using Power BI and SQL. The dataset includes various types of attendance records, such as Present (P), Work from Home (WFH), Sick Leave (SL), and Weekly Off (WO), and spans over several months.

## Key Features

1. **Optimized Attendance Tracking**: 
   - Analyzed 849 present days and 139 work-from-home entries to generate insights on workforce availability.
   
2. **Automated Leave Trend Analysis**:
   - Tracked 9 sick leaves and 662 weekly offs to help HR teams monitor employee leave trends and maintain operational efficiency.
   
3. **Data Transformation and KPI Calculation**:
   - Used Power BI to clean and transform raw attendance data into actionable KPIs, enabling more effective HR decision-making.

4. **SQL Query Optimization**:
   - Leveraged SQL to aggregate and query attendance data across multiple sheets, enhancing data accuracy and reducing processing time for payroll and performance evaluations.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization, transformation, and KPI reporting.
- **SQL**: For querying, filtering, and aggregating attendance data.

## How to Run

1. **Power BI**: Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI and generate reports using the pre-built dashboards.
2. **SQL**: Use the provided SQL scripts to query attendance data for specific insights or aggregations.
